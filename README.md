### GÃ¡bor SzabÃ³, teaching Python, Git, GitHub, and Docker

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am helping people writter higher quality code faster through my course and enable them to create more value to their employers. I also teach peaople how to contribute to open source projects. I taught in a number of cities around the world: in Austin, Chicago, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Oslo, Lisbon, Pisa, Riga, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Rehovot, just to name some of them. Since the corona virus started I taught mostly on-line though in-person training is coming back.

In this repository you will find many open source projects I have been working on. The most imporant ones are listed below.

### Sponsor me!

Besides working on some Open Source projects of my own, I also try to contribute to many other projects. These are usually relatively small and external contributions, but I belive they can be quite valuable.
* Updating META data of the project (e.g. including a link back to their GitHub repo so people on PyPI, RubyGems, MetaCPAN, etc. will be able to locate the VCS)
* Adding tests
* Configuring GitHub Actions as a CI to run the tests on every push and every pull-request

Sponsor me to allow me to do more of this!
