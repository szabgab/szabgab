### Sponsor me!

Besides working on some Open Source projects of my own, I also try to contribute to many other projects. These are usually relatively small and external contributions, but I belive they can be quite valuable.
* Updating META data of the project (e.g. including a link back to their GitHub repo so people on PyPI, RubyGems, MetaCPAN, etc. will be able to locate the VCS)
* Adding tests
* Configuring GitHub Actions as a CI to run the tests on every push and every pull-request

Sponsor me to allow me to do more of this!
