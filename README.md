### GÃ¡bor SzabÃ³, Open Source contributor, teacher, and consultant

Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I maintain a number of Open Source projects and contribute improvements to hundreds of other projects. I organize live online presentations about [Rust, Python, and Perl](https://live.code-maven.com/). I maintain the web site of [Rust](https://rust.org.il/), [Python](https://python.org.il/), and [Perl](https://perl.org.il/) communities in Israel.

At my corporate clients I help people writter higher quality code faster and enable them to create more value to their employers and to the world. I taught in a number of cities around the world: in Austin, Chicago, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Oslo, Lisbon, Pisa, Riga, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Rehovot, just to name some of them.

The main programming languages are Rust, Python, and Perl.

Git, GitHub, and Docker

### Sponsor me!

Besides working on some Open Source projects of my own, I also try to contribute to many other projects. These are usually relatively small and external contributions, but I belive they can be quite valuable.
* Updating META data of the project (e.g. including a link back to their GitHub repo so people on PyPI, RubyGems, MetaCPAN, etc. will be able to locate the VCS)
* Adding tests
* Configuring GitHub Actions as a CI to run the tests on every push and every pull-request

Sponsor me to allow me to do more of this!
